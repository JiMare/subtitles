1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,180
You think life is full of surprises?

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,700
Don't even get me started on death.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,720
Let me tell you about my

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,780
brilliant master plan.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,700
But before you judge me

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,420
try to put yourself in my shoes:

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,620
a completely out of control gambling habit

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,820
i know you're telling me...

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,400
Yeah, so that;

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,660
the resulting mounting debt,

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,390
and one very questionable 

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,660
Russian businessman.

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,300
And then I decided to run off with his money.

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,360
So,

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,070
when it came down to it, I could face

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,020
retribution

17
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,160
blackmail

18
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,400
shame

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,700
prison.

20
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,860
Or,

21
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,340
I could put it all on double zero.

22
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,990
Now, the problem was: how do you find an actual

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,270
treasure hidden inside 

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,100
a huge hospital building?

25
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,280
So,

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,790
I warmed my way into having an office there

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,220
and got to work.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,350
I studied blueprints,

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,140
got a precious metal detector...

30
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,640
Bottom line:

31
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,560
there was gold. A bunch of it, hidden

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,500
underneath the library floorboards.

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,830
But how do I get in there without raising

34
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,740
suspicion?

35
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,390
That's where crazy baldy came into play

36
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,900
with his absurd cult.

37
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,920
His whole

38
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,990
stunt with the media around arguing over

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,820
the Faust House was the perfect pretext.

40
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,470
I set fire to the library floor in the

41
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,620
shape of their little

42
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,420
"pentagram"

43
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,280
(the cat

44
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,020
was just a last minute addition.

45
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,140
I ran over the poor thing on my way there.

46
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,380
I figured it would add some flair.)

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,910
I don't even think that Lafferty guy even

48
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,280
knew I existed. He was

49
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,350
obviously not the one who killed me, he was

50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,260
just some

51
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,550
snake oil salesman that could serve 

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,620
as a good cover story.

53
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,280
So that was part one of the plan done.

54
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,910
Soon they started to work on the floors and

55
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,660
I was just waiting for my moment.

56
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,900
Part two was trickier, though.

57
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,380
I knew i'd never get Ivan off my back;

58
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,980
and if he got wind that I came into money,

59
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,660
the blackmail would only get worse.

60
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,740
So, I figured my only option was

61
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,080
to die.

62
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,030
That meant saying goodbye to my 

63
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,940
sweet Elizabeth.

64
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,260
She-

65
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,180
she couldn't keep a secret for the life of her.

66
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,830
But i figured I could pay her back with

67
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,660
plenty of interest with the insurance policy!

68
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,740
My sweet Elizabeth.

69
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,000
she-

70
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,540
loved me.

71
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,460
Until the very end.

72
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,310
So, I figured to make my suicide more

73
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,150
believable, the heavy rains and

74
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,070
flooding made throwing myself in the river

75
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,060
a good option.

76
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,910
Nobody would be surprised that they

77
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,180
couldn't find my body.

78
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:03,880
But still-

79
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,900
I needed a good reason - a little

80
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,310
dramatic flair, you know, that pushed me over

81
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,180
the edge.

82
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,190
I felt a little bad for blaming 

83
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,980
Chief Vykryl

84
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,710
I mean I did string him along 

85
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,860
the entire time, but-

86
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,820
I didn't feel that bad.

87
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,780
That guy's a fucking creep.

88
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,100
So, I bought a fake passport

89
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,660
- surprisingly easy -

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,100
rented a van,

91
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,420
and and made a convincing suicide note.

92
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,950
Then i just waited for everyone 

93
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,180
to go home for the weekend

94
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,670
Then I planned to take my time wheeling the

95
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,220
gold out in my suitcase.

96
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,640
Then I was off to Switzerland with their

97
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,900
excellent anonymous banking system.

98
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,960
Then that cop

99
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,300
Svab

100
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,380
started snooping around.

101
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,160
I just

102
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,590
I couldn't have him poking his nose in

103
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,150
unannounced to "investigate the crime scene"

104
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,700
for the hundredth time

105
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,940
So, I arranged a meeting with him at my office.

106
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,240
And just to think that was one of my last

107
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,740
experiences in life...

108
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,440
Anyway-

109
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,900
I thought that took care of everything.

110
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,350
Who could have known that earlier that day

111
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,040
while she was working on the floorboards 

112
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,100
sweet, quiet little Eva

113
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,620
had stumbled into a gold bar.

114
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,580
When she came back for it

115
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,580
- all shaky, the poor dear -

116
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,980
I was in the middle of dinner.

117
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,260
I heard a noise.

118
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,780
And I saw her carrying a gold bar.

119
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,980
Just one.

120
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,430
Grandma always said, you know, my family was

121
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,510
cursed with greed. She said that that's what

122
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,780
killed my parents-

123
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,700
I don't know.

124
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,580
But in that moment I just

125
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,020
I couldn't let her have it.

126
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,100
Not even one.

127
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,480
We fought over it

128
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,900
for a while

129
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,780
and uh

130
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,220
then I saw it

131
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,580
in her eye.

132
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,670
I don't get scared that easily but I

133
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,740
knew to be scared then.

134
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,020
And in a split second she

135
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,740
changed

136
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,740
she pushed me.

137
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,460
And I mean what are the fucking odds...

138
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,580
But-

139
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,860
I just remember

140
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,540
warmth

141
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,740
and

142
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,740
quiet.

143
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,420
Finally.

144
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,260
And I remember her apologizing

145
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,580
over and over;

146
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,180
and I felt bad for her.

147
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,020
And I felt bad for myself.

148
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,460
It's funny, you know.

149
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,200
Dying can really solve a lot of your anger issues.

150
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,020
I can almost recommend it.
