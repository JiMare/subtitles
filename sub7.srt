00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,880
<b><font color='#fed64e'>Yes, my father did
work in that godforsaken house.</font></b>

2
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,079
<b><font color='#fed64e'>He was head of
the hospital back then.</font></b>

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,359
<b><font color='#fed64e'>I was very little,
but I remember glimpses of it.</font></b>

4
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,839
<b><font color='#fed64e'>And it's no coincidence
that Sarah was at that house.</font></b>

5
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,200
<b><font color='#fed64e'>It was about half a year ago.</font></b>
<b><font color='#fed64e'>She came to visit.</font></b>

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,479
<b><font color='#fed64e'>I could tell right away
that something was very wrong.</font></b>

7
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,320
<b><font color='#fed64e'>It didn't take much prodding.</font></b>

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,880
<b><font color='#fed64e'>Apparently she
owed money, a lot of it,</font></b>

9
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,200
<b><font color='#fed64e'>to some very</font></b>
<b><font color='#fed64e'> scary people.</font></b>

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,920
<b><font color='#fed64e'>I told her not to worry.</font></b>

11
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,520
<b><font color='#fed64e'>"Move out here," I said. "Start
a fresh." "I'll settle all your debts.</font></b>

12
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,000
<b><font color='#fed64e'>I mean, what am I
going to do with all this?"</font></b>

13
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,719
<b><font color='#fed64e'>But she wouldn't have it.</font></b>

14
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,079
<b><font color='#fed64e'>She was a good girl at heart.</font></b>

15
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,480
<b><font color='#fed64e'>Hated seeing me sell my
inheritance to pay her debts.</font></b>

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,400
<b><font color='#fed64e'>But I could
tell it was serious.</font></b>

17
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:31,319
<b><font color='#fed64e'>And so I lost my
good sense, fool that I am.</font></b>

18
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,120
<b><font color='#fed64e'>"There may be
another way," I said.</font></b>

19
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,159
<b><font color='#fed64e'>"I held my tongue for decades,</font></b>

20
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:49,239
<b><font color='#fed64e'>but it was so hard</font></b>
<b><font color='#fed64e'>to see her suffer so</font></b>

21
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,359
<b><font color='#fed64e'>much good </font></b>
<b><font color='#fed64e'>did that to her."</font></b>

22
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:59,159
<b><font color='#fed64e'>My father was a
very successful man,</font></b>

23
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,200
<b><font color='#fed64e'>as was his father before him.</font></b>

24
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,480
<b><font color='#fed64e'>As the war drew nearer,</font></b>

25
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,639
<b><font color='#fed64e'>my parents only realized </font></b>
<b><font color='#fed64e'>they would have to flee</font></b>

26
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,039
<b><font color='#fed64e'>when it was almost too late.</font></b>

27
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,240
<b><font color='#fed64e'>It certainly wasn't possible </font></b>
<b><font color='#fed64e'>to get out any amount of wealth.</font></b>

28
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,520
<b><font color='#fed64e'>The noose had tightened.</font></b>

29
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,879
<b><font color='#fed64e'>We were lucky to
get out with our lives.</font></b>

30
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,479
<b><font color='#fed64e'>But my father
wasn't going to leave at all.</font></b>

31
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,560
<b><font color='#fed64e'>He bought up lots of gold.</font></b>

32
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,400
<b><font color='#fed64e'>People were
hiding their treasures</font></b>

33
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,240
<b><font color='#fed64e'>in the walls and
the cellars of their houses.</font></b>

34
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,479
<b><font color='#fed64e'>But my father
saw that wasn't safe,</font></b>

35
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,639
<b><font color='#fed64e'>and he came up with a plan.</font></b>

36
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,599
<b><font color='#fed64e'>"Hide it at the
hospital, in the Faust House."</font></b>

37
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,120
<b><font color='#fed64e'>So we fled,</font></b>

38
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,840
<b><font color='#fed64e'>first to London and
eventually to the States.</font></b>

39
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,560
<b><font color='#fed64e'>My father got a job
at a hospital in Connecticut,</font></b>

40
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,759
<b><font color='#fed64e'>and he never did get a
chance to go back for his wealth.</font></b>

41
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,039
<b><font color='#fed64e'>Towards the end
he was a man possessed.</font></b>

42
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,439
<b><font color='#fed64e'>"That's your wealth
hidden in that house," he said.</font></b>

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,120
<b><font color='#fed64e'>"Your future hidden
in that house," he said.</font></b>

44
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,919
<b><font color='#fed64e'>"Your future,
always the future."</font></b>

45
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,879
<b><font color='#fed64e'>Ambition.</font></b>

46
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,479
<b><font color='#fed64e'>I seem to be the only one
who doesn't have the obsession.</font></b>

47
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,360
<b><font color='#fed64e'>I half-forgot the story.</font></b>

48
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,439
<b><font color='#fed64e'>Something in me told me
I should take it to my grave,</font></b>

49
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,360
<b><font color='#fed64e'>as of course
I should have done.</font></b>

50
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,479
<b><font color='#fed64e'>After I told
Sara, she was changed.</font></b>

51
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,479
<b><font color='#fed64e'>Soon after,</font></b>
<b><font color='#fed64e'>moved out here</font></b>

52
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,240
<b><font color='#fed64e'>and got a job</font></b>
<b><font color='#fed64e'> in that house.</font></b>

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,400
<b><font color='#fed64e'>I comforted myself.</font></b>

54
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,040
<b><font color='#fed64e'>Thinking whatever</font></b>
<b><font color='#fed64e'> had been hidden there</font></b>

55
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,800
<b><font color='#fed64e'>would surely</font></b>
<b><font color='#fed64e'>long be gone.</font></b>

56
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,600
<b><font color='#fed64e'>She wouldn't find anything</font></b>

57
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:31,079
<b><font color='#fed64e'>and eventually come to
her senses and accept my offer.</font></b>

58
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:34,399
<b><font color='#fed64e'>But now I think...</font></b>
